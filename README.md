## Exercises for beginners in TypeScript on for and while loops. Introduction to recursion and object oriented.

Here we have a **series of exercises** for practicing **for and while loops, oriented-object**, my first method implementations (to understand what's going on **under the hood**). My first programs and projects with **node.js** to read files in the **shell** and folders (like **cat** or **ls**) to learn and understand the notions of **permissions**, **try**, **throw** and **catch**, **promises, call-back** and so on. We'll also see our first notion of **recursivity**.
These are great learning exercises, and once you've completed them, they'll be a **great addition to your toolbox**.

Enjoy!
